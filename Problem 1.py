Take age or year or birth as an input from the user and tell them when they will turn 100 years old.(5 points)
Donâ€™t use any type of module like datetime or dateutils(-5 points).

They can then optionally provide a year and your program must tell their age in that particular year. (3 points)
You should be handling all sorts of errors like (2 points):
    -You are not yet born
    -You seem to be the oldest person alive
    -You can also handle any other error if possible!
